# Amtrak Analysis


### Description

The purpose of this project was to:
- build a transferable approach to forecasting many statistical models at once 
- practice splitting out yearly data to a monthly grain


### Data

The data used for this analysis was scraped from  [here](https://www.railpassengers.org/resources/ridership-statistics/) page.  The scraping proved to be a little difficult so there was more time early on spent on validating the data.


### Challenges
- The main challenge came from validating the data and the amount of time required to sufficiently check all the numbers.
